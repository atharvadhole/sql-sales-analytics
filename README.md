# SQL Sales Analytics

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data using SQL to answer real business questions related to revenue, customers, and product performance.

## Tools & Technologies
- MySQL
- SQL (JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, DISTINCT, DATE functions)

## Database Design
The database is designed using a normalized relational structure with the following tables:
- customers
- products
- sales
- sales_items
- payments

Primary keys and foreign keys are used to maintain data integrity and relationships.

## Business Questions Solved
- What is the total sales amount per month?
- Which customers purchased more than one distinct product?
- How much has each customer spent in total?
- Which products generate the highest revenue?
- How many orders are placed each month?
